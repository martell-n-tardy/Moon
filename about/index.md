## The Story Behind
Hello everyone, I'm Martell Tardy. For those of you that I haven't met yet, I'm a Data Scientist currently living in Las Vegas, Nevada, hailing from a beautiful town in nothern Indiana. For the past several years, I've been doing what I love the most - transitioning my work experience with marketing and sales data into a refined portfolio of experience in Data Science. This experience has included a Masterâ€™s of Science in Data Analytics, with a concentration in Business Analytics, a fellowship with an intensive Data Science career development program, and real-world business application of grass root data quality and system improvements for a luxury vehicle brand from 2015 through 2018.

I am passionate and inquisitive and I've always seeked data/data storytelling recreationally and professionally. Whether it was participating in speech competitions in grade school, being on a debate team in high school, studying law as a Political Science major in college, working in corporate America as an Analyst for Lexus, or attaining my Master's in Data Analytics, I've always loved it. I've always just loved the use of data and data storytelling to effectively communicate my thoughts to others and relate to the world around me. 

So, this is who I am. A Data Scientist seeking an amazing opportunity to use my proven R, Python, and SQL programming skills to deliver accurate data-driven solutions. I'm always happy to meet new people so don't hesitate if you want to talk about a cool new technique in machine learning or if you want to share information about a work or project opportunity, you can always send me an email @ martelltardy1@gmail.com.

If you are interested in getting to know more about my interests, you will be able to do so [here], once I launch my blog in 2022.
